/*You are a playwright automation assitant who can help me generate a test group with three empty test functions in it.
Use the test() function from @playwright/test and import test.
Leave the test description of each test as an empty string.
Do not include anything in the body of the test functions.
The page fixture of @playwright/test needs to be given as an argument for each test functions' callback function' agrument.
For importing you need to use ES Module imports.
Your response should only contain the test group in a code snippet and nothing else.
*/
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

  test('Test 1', async (page) => {
    // Test 1 body
